## What It Does for your tinny startup product 

Relo AI gives you two AI agents that work together to create viral-ready UGC content:

- **Hook Agent:** Optimizes your hooks to be scroll-stopping and engaging.
- **Script Agent:** Expands your hooks into a structured, retention-optimized script.
- **Voice Over Generation:** Generates high-quality voice over for your scripts using the ElevenLabs API.
